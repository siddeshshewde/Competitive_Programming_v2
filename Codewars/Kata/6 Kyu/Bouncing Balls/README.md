A child plays with a ball on the nth floor of a big building. The height of this floor is known:
```
(float parameter "h" in meters, h > 0) .
```
He lets out the ball. The ball rebounds for example to two-thirds:
```
(float parameter "bounce", 0 < bounce < 1)
```
of its height.

His mother looks out of a window that is 1.5 meters from the ground:
```
(float parameters window < h).
```
How many times will the mother see the ball either falling or bouncing in front of the window
```
(return a positive integer unless conditions are not fulfilled in which case return -1) ?
```
Note

You will admit that the ball can only be seen if the height of the rebouncing ball is stricty greater than the window parameter.

Example:
```
h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3

h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1
```
