Create a function that receives a (square) matrix and calculates the sum of both diagonals (main and secondary)

Matrix = array of n length whose elements are n length arrays of integers.
3x3 example:
```
sum_diagonals[
  [ 1, 2, 3 ],
  [ 4, 5, 6 ],
  [ 7, 8, 9 ]
] ) == 20 # 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 7
```
