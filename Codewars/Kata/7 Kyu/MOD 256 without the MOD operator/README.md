The MOD-operator % (aka mod/modulus/remainder):

Returns the remainder of a division operation.
The sign of the result is the same as the sign of the first operand.
(Different behavior in Python!)
The short unbelievable mad story for this kata:
I wrote a program and needed the remainder of the division by 256. And then it happened: The "5"/"%"-Key did not react.
It must be broken! So I needed a way to:

Calculate the remainder of the division by 256 without the %-operator.
Also here some examples:

Input 254  -> Result 254
Input 256  -> Result 0
Input 258  -> Result 2 
Input -258 -> Result -2 (in Python: Result: 254!)
It is always expected the behavior of the MOD-Operator of the language!

The input number will always between -10000 and 10000.

For some languages the %-operator will be blocked. If it is not blocked and you know how to block it, tell me and I will include it.

For all, who say, this would be a duplicate: No, this is no duplicate! There are two katas, in that you have to write a
general method for MOD without %. But this kata is only for MOD 256. And so you can create also other specialized solutions. ;-)

Of course you can use the digit "5" in your solution. :-)

I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. I found several interesting "funny" ways.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!
