You are given two arrays a1 and a2 of strings. Each string is composed with letters from a to z. Let x be any string in the first array and y be any string in the second array.

Find max(abs(length(x) âˆ’ length(y)))

If a1 or a2 are empty return -1 in each language except in Haskell where you will return Nothing.

Example:
```
s1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]
s2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]
mxdiflg(s1, s2) --> 13
```
