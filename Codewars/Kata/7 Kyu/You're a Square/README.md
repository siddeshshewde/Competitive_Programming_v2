You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

    In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the 
    square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with
    itself.
    
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
```
Square.isSquare(-1) // => false
Square.isSquare( 3) // => false
Square.isSquare( 4) // => true
Square.isSquare(25) // => true
Square.isSquare(26) // => false
```
