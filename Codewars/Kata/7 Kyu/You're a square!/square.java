Title:
	You're a square!

Description:
	You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

	However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task:
	Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

	In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

	The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples:
	isSquare(-1) returns   false
	isSquare(0)  returns   true
	isSquare(3)  returns   false
	isSquare(4)  returns   true
	isSquare(25) returns   true  
	isSquare(26) returns   false
