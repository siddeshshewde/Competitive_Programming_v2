Every month, a random number of students take the driving test at Fast & Furious(F&F) Driving School.
To pass the test, a student cannot accumulate more than 18 demerit points.

At the end of the month, F&F wants to calculate the average demerit points accumulated by ONLY the students
who have passed,rounded to the nearest integer.

Write a function which would allow them to do so. If no students passed the test that month, return 'No pass scores registered.'. 


Example:
```
[10,10,10,18,20,20] --> 12
```
Note:
The maximum number of demerit points a student can score before the tester calls it a day is 40.
