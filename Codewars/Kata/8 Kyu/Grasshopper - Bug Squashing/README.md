# Terminal game bug squashing
You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. 
In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: 
 roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

You are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a function named main that calls the functions in the proper order.
```
- `combat`
- `buy_health`
- `get_coins`
- `print_status`
- `roll_dice`
- `move`
```
