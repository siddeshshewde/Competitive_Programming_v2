# Grasshopper if/else review
In the game you are creating, the role of the main function is to check the input and return a call to the appropriate function.

The preloaded function available are forward() and backward().

The possible inputs and the required actions are:
```
"forward": call the forward() function, and return its result
"backward": call the backward() function, and return its result
anything else: return "Not a valid input."
```
