# Password generator.





'''
The password generator must generate random strings that are N characters in length, N here can be any reasonable method of input as long as the value of N only exists once in the code and can be changed easily. If you're not sure whether the input method is valid please do ask. The password generator function must have the ability to output all of the following and nothing extra 
 !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~


Notes:
It should be random each time you run it
pseudorandom is fine
the value of N is not included in the submission but the code assigning it to a variable is so in the code var foo = 10 the var foo= part is counted but 10 is not
